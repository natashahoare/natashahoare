*Distributors*, at West, The Hague
Curator: Remco Torenbosch

Distributors takes on multiple forms of address: an exhibition, a roundtable, and a booklet that gathers works that challenge systems of distribution in relation to production. Brought together by the Dutch artist Remco Torenbosch, Distributors takes a perspective on the flow of material and the precarity of the subject. As a whole these forms becomes self-reflexive by questioning how the dissociation of capital differs from (art)production as realized in an abstracted globalized economy.

I will moderate a roundtable on Tuesday 8 December 2015 with Marja Bloem, Willem de Rooij, and Sven Augustijnen.
