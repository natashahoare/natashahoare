I recently interviewed exciting young artist Jeremy Hutchison for the website Ibraaz regarding his recent residency in Ramallah, and upcoming group exhibition Points of Departure at the ICA, London.

Hutchison works across installation, video and performance, often exploring the absurdity of the everyday; a strategy employed to make visible power structures inherent to global flows of production, while offering disruptive proposals for alternative situations.
