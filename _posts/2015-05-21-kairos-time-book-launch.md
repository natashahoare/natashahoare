To celebrate the book launch of the catalogue Kairos Time, an exhibition of Piet Zwart students which took place last year at TENT, Rotterdam, I participated in a round table discussion on the ideas underpinning the exhibition – the concept of a generation and using opportunism as a counter strategy in neoliberal society – led by the editor of the catalogue and the curator of the show Matteo Lucchetti.
