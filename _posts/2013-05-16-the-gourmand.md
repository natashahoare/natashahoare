I am excited to announce my new role as Arts Editor of food and culture magazine, The Gourmand.

The next issue includes a feature I've written on Gordon Matta-Clark's practice, the legendary SoHo restaurant he co-founded FOOD and reflections on the continual re-staging of countercultural moments from yesteryear.

You can pre-order a copy of the magazine [here](http://thegourmand.co.uk/issues/show/issue-02).
