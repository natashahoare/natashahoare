title: The Catlin Guide 2013 – New Artists in the UK
category: Publicity
---

The press campaign for the Catlin Guide 2013 has just launched in the lead up to the Guide being unveiled at the London Art Fair 2013, on 16th January. The Guide introduces 40 of the most exciting new artists in the UK, selected from a six-month, nationwide survey by curator Justin Hammond. Despite many recent debates regarding the wisdom of the surge in graduate art sales and prices, the Guide is a vital step for many graduates leaving the university network, providing them with visibility in what is a very busy landscape. I am especially pleased to see two Chelsea colleagues on the list this year: Tom Railton and Rosie Farrell.

Now in its fourth year, The Catlin Guide is established as an essential reference for followers of contemporary art and the only publication to provide an authoritative overview of new art in the UK. Each artist profile details future exhibitions, projects and aspirations for the coming year. The book will be unveiled alongside work by a selection of the featured artists, with a limited number of free copies given away to visitorsto The Catlin Guide stand on each day of the fair.

The final list of 40 artists will spotlight new graduates working in a variety of media, highlighting the wealth of creativity and ideas currently emerging from our art schools. Featured artists include Steven Allan and Nicky Deeley from the Royal College of Art, painters Alex Ball (Slade School of Fine Art) and Rafal Topolewski (Manchester Metropolitan University), Lydia Brain (Fine Art: Print & Time Based Media, Wimbledon College of Art), filmmaker Josephine Sowden (University of Wales, Newport) and photographic artists Virgílio Ferreira (University of Brighton) and Juno Calypso (London College of Communication). Juno’s elaborately staged photographs such as ‘Artificial Sweetener’ (pictured above) examine modern rituals of seduction and beauty and have earned her the LCC Hotshoe Portfolio Award and the Michael Wilson Photographic Prize.
