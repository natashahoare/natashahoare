Now working as Curator at Witte de With Center for Contemporary Art.

I’ve worked alongside the team on a fantastic panoply of projects in the past year and a half – *Art in the Age Of…Energy and Raw Material*, *Art In The Age Of…Asymmetrical Warfare*, *NO HUMANS INVOLVED*, and most recently *Para Fictions* and *Relational Stalinism – The Musical* with artist Michael Portnoy. Not to mention events, screenings, symposia, and publications…looking forward to projects to come.
