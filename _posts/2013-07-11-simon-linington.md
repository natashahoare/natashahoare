I have recently written a catalogue essay for the exhibition Closer.

Closer takes its name from Joy Division’s eponymous final album, released two months after the death of front man Ian Curtis. The record was one that artist Simon Linington played over and over again, until the worn CD produced only clicking and scraping sounds. This obsessive tendency, one that transformed the angular dirges of Curtis et al into abstract noise, is at the heart of the new body of work presented in this show. Here repetition is used to trace the passage of time, interrogate the possibility of a representation of the self, and to delineate the artist’s physical relationship to the studio space.

The exhibition runs until 3rd August, 2013.
