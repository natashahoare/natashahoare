For issue 6 of The Gourmand I have contributed an article on Yoko Ono and the relationship between her practice and food, reflecting on eating as an act in her instructional pieces.

“Ono’s oeuvre extends beyond the white cube and into the realm of everyday life through its embracing of varied media and an emphasis on participation; her artworks are staged to be completed by audiences themselves, rather than remaining discrete objects rendered solely by the artist. What is most powerful about her work perhaps is the genuine belief that art, music and the manner in which each individual lives their life, can bring about profound global change. This belief remains true to this day.”
