An exhibition by Turner Prize winning artist Mark Wallinger at the Freud Museum. The project consists of a site-specific work created for Freud’s study and a permanent sculpture to be situated in the Museum garden.

In *Self Reflection* Wallinger installs a mirror across the entire ceiling of the iconic study offering visitors a dramatic new perspective effectively doubling the space.

*‘The relative posture of the sitting analyst and the recumbent analysand are latent in Freud’s chair and the couch. We can easily imagine his patient’s self-reflection.’*

Outside the sculpture Self takes the form of the most basic expression of what it means to exist as an individual: the letter “I,” as a free-standing figure. Placed in the garden in clear view from Sigmund Freud’s desk the sculpture has an intensity of meaning; the formation of the id, ego, and superego is predicated on our knowledge of the self and how it is constituted.

The project marks the Freud Museum London’s 30th anniversary and the 160th anniversary of the birth of Sigmund Freud. Running from 22nd July – 25th September, 2016.

Supported by Arts Council England, Art Fund, and Hauser & Wirth.
