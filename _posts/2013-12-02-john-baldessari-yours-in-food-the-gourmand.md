title: John Baldessari; Yours in Food - The Gourmand
category: Texts
---

My latest article for The Gourmand explores American Artist John Baldessariâ€™s iconography of food. Singing the writings of Sol LeWitt; hitting objects with a golf club; waving at boats; vowing never to make boring art and then photographing suburban highways; each of his pieces forms a new link in a consistent line of enquiry that started in Los Angeles in the 1950s, a city dominated by the dream factory of Hollywood, and considered a dead zone by the art world.
