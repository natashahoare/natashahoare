I am currently working on a book called The New Curator, to be published by Laurence King in 2015. The book collects 25 interviews with 25 international curators and artist curators, focussing on a specific exhibition or project. Interviewee’s include Maria Lind, Art Angel, Khaled Hourani, Anthony Huberman, Chus Martinez, Leah Gordon, Adam Sutherland, Clark House Initiative, Ragnar Kjartansson and Andjeas Ejiksson, Mami Kataoka and many more.

*‘The book presents a snapshot of the most interesting curatorial practices in the art world today. There is an emphasis on the ‘now’: the introduction sketches in the development of curatorial practices since the 1980s but the shows under scrutiny in the following 25 case studies have all taken place in the last few years.

The selected exhibitions – chosen by an expert panel of curators – run the global gamut, from Europe and the US through Africa and the Middle East to China, and illustrate the particular challenges for curators working in both the commercial and public sectors. Large-scale shows and pop-up exhibits, permanent-collection rehangs and art fairs all have a place here.

Each highly illustrated case study is structured around an interview with the curator responsible for the show. The text both tells the story of the show’s making and fills in background information about the curator’s work, resulting in an accessible guide to contemporary curating.’*
